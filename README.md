### ðŸš€ How is the WPM calculated ? 
WPM (Words Per Minute) is a calculation of exactly how fast you type with no error penalties. 

When calculating typing speed, a "word" is any five characters. For instance, "I love keyboarding, don't you?" would be counted as 6 words (30 characters / 5) and not just 5. This makes sense because typing "deinstitutionalization" obviously should count more than typing "my". Spaces, numbers, letters, and punctuation are all included, but any function keys such as Shift or Backspace are **not** included.

This makes the number of words easy to calculate. Simply count all typed entries and divide by five to get the number of words typed. To give an example, if you typed 200 characters in 1 minute, your net wpm typing speed would be (200 characters / 5) / 1 min = 40 WPM. If you typed 200 characters in 30 seconds your net speed would be (200/5) / 0.5 = 80 WPM
